    "In rotor dynamics a Rotating Reference Frame (RRF) $(O'X'Y'Z')$ attached the structure is often used, see Figure 2. Since the (RRF) is rotationg with the structure, there is no relative moviment between them, which implies that the deformation seen from the (RRF) is very small, which allow us to use small defomation theory, but the material derivative must be modified in order to compute the right accelation and velocity a material point.\n",

Also, in order to facilitate the construction of the Campbell diagram, a simple [Python](https://www.python.org/) api was develloped for modifying the Ansys Apdl Initial case and the retrieve the results back to python. In order to use the [pyAPDL](), we user must create a based APDL script contain the mesh mesh and the boundary condition. Then, it is possible to create a simple function that runs a static analysis with a rotation speed, build the $K_c$ matrix, run a presstressed modal analysis, and finally imports the frequencies to python.
